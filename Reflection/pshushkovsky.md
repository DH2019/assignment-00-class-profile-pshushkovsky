# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists
This flipping cards layout could be used for contact information on websites. This would be especially useful on university websites listing professors, their course codes and emails. 
Students could also develop webpages using this technique to collaborate on study notes. Each student could be responsible for preparing information on a certain term, key date or person. This could all be compiled onto the small webpage and be used for future studying references.
Sports teams could also use this technique on their webpage to provide information on each player. For example, their name, age, score, position and etc.
Conferences could also use this layout for various events or key note speakers on their website. Listing information such as location and field for each.


## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 
The 'researcher' may be responsible for checking if the content of each participant is appropriate. He may also act as an 'editor' suggesting changes where he deems it may be necessary. This could be in the form of grammar and spell check. He may also in some cases suggest editing content to ensure it is cohesive, appropriate or up to its best standard. 
The final end product is up to the participants, to a certain extent. They may choose to ignore comments on certain content issues, but the ‘researcher’ must interfere if the content is inappropriate, for example discriminatory. 
The ‘researcher’ may also be responsible for becoming familiar with the content.


## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?
In the example of Professors, you could have fields such as: First name, last name, department, courses teaching, email, phone number, etc.
For the example of sports team’s players, similarly as listed above: First name, last name, age, number, years on team, playing position, ranking, etc.
In the example of a study website it could have: Key event, date, actors, outcomes, influence, etc.
In the last example of a study website using these 'fields' may be slightly complicated since they may differ depending on what each student is researching. One student may be researching the importance of a person, for example "Churchill", but another person may be researching a term, such as "Multiculturalism." Therefore, for some there may not be a key date and the 'fields' needed would vary. Not all fields would be necessary or more fields would need to be added.
